# VTEX Whoami to VSCode

VTEX Whoami is a extension to VSCode which allows you to show account and workspace information in the status bar.

This extension works in partnership with [VTEX ToolBelt](https://github.com/vtex/toolbelt), in other words, it reads information from the VTEX's CLI and shows it in the status bar of VSCode
